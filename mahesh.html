<h2 style="color:blue;"> Welcome to MY TREAVEL BLOG </h2>

<p>Are you visiting Udaipur in Rajasthan? Plan a one day trip to Chittorgarh Fort, when deciding on an itinerary. The Chittorgarh Fort is the biggest fort in India, with magnificent architecture and vibrant and exciting history, of valiant kings, battles and sieges, and tales of romance and Jauhar.
 </p>
<p>   
I was in <i>Udaipur</i>, for a friend's son's wedding, where I met up with a bunch of old friends. We extended our stay by a few days, and spent the time, exploring places of interest around this beautiful city. It was the time when the movie Padmavat was in the news, hogging primetime debates on national television, and eliciting quite a controversy. Curiosity got the better of us, and we couldn't resist the urge to visit Chittorgarh, the famed site where history was created. 

We set off early, seated comfortably in a Tempo Traveller, booked the previous evening. Chittorgarh is roughly <strong>115 km</strong> from Udaipur, and it takes just over <strong>2 ½</strong> hours to reach. It's a comfortable stretch on well-laid National Highways. I mention this, because it's good enough for a road trip, on a bike or car. Public transport, between the two cities, is good too. 

The driver's assistant (Kuldip) acted as our unofficial tour guide. Kuldip qualified for the part, born and brought up, as he was, in those parts. He had many a tale of romance and bravery to share. Of course, none could be authenticated, but his constant jabber kept us engaged and piqued our interest.

<p>
Once you're there, you can't stop being in awe of the place. I got goosebumps, as I stood admiring the sheer size and grandeur of the fort. It is a magnificent structure, standing atop a 180-metre-high hill, spreading across roughly 692 acres, offering panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. It has the distinction of being the largest fort in the country. That must tell you something about its size and grandiose.</p>

<p>The Chittorgarh Fort is one of the eight sites, in Rajasthan, declared as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. There is no concrete evidence on who built it, but historians estimate that it was raised in the 7th century, during the reign of the Mauryan Empire. 
</p>
<p>The splendour of the fort is not limited to its size and dimensions. It is also recognised for its unique and well-perceived architecture. <strong>There are 84 artificially made reservoirs around the fort, and they are a pure genius — their presence illustrates the well-thought-of construction, in medieval times. The water bodies were so designed that they could hold sufficient water to meet the water requirements for a fleet of 50,000 soldiers for four years running </strong>.</p>
<p>Seven gates lead to the fort; the main entrance is called Ram Pol. The gates were designed intelligently to prevent the enemy from entering or attacking the fort. What you see today are the ruins, but they paint such a compelling picture of a glorious past. Not everything is run and torn down; we were told around 65 monuments still stand, mainly palaces, temples, towers and cenotaphs. The victory towers are the most striking structures. 
</p>

<p><strong>Myths of Chittorgarh</p></strong>

<p>Kuldip regaled us with many anecdotes; some seemed farfetched, but legends are part of the belief of people. One titbit that he shared with us was that the Bhim (one of the Pandava) built the fort, in one night. Another fascinating story was on how Bhimlat Kund, one of the 84 reservoirs got its name. Myth has it that Bhim became thirsty, and there was no water on the hilltop. So, he struck the ground and water appeared in that spot. 
</p>
<p><strong>Legend of Rani Padmini or Padmavati</p></strong>

<p>According to legend, Padmavati was a strikingly beautiful princess, married to <strong>Raja Ratan Singh</strong>, the ruler of <strong>Mewar</strong>. Her gorgeous good looks resulted in her being the central character for numerous ballads and narratives. She is the subject of several folktales originating in the region. The most famous piece on her is credited to Sufi poet, Malik Muhammad Jayasi. His poem romanticised the legendary queen, giving her a mystical aura. 
</p>
<p>
The ballad, titled Padmavat, reads like a fairytale, centring around talking parrots extolling the beauty of the queen and the drama that unfolded, involving Ratan Singh and Allaudin Khiji and ending with Padmavat committing Jauhar. What parts are facts and which fiction is not known.
